"""Regression tests for v3.19 hybrid wake confirmation.

The pre-confirm drain (``_drain_pending_audio(reason="post-wake-pre-confirm")``)
that was present in v3.17/v3.18 is gone. ASR must receive the wake audio so it
can re-transcribe the wake phrase and confirm the wake.

These tests pin two behaviours:

1. ASR sees the wake chunk via inline tap inside ``_handle_kws``.
2. Audio chunks queued in the wake buffer are NOT drained before the confirm
   window opens — they flow into ``_handle_wait_asr_confirm``.
